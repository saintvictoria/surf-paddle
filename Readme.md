### Surf & Paddle

Your homework today is to recreate the Surf and Paddle mockup (surf-paddle.png).

All of the assets you should need are located in the `/assets` folder. Feel free to swap out the images though if you want. You can use any of the placeholder image tools out there.

This needs to be as pixel perfect as you can make it. To help with this you can use the Chrome Plugin, [PerfectPixel](http://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/). I will be overlaying the mockup to check your homework.

You should also use [Normalize CSS](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

Also, you will need to utilize [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts)

This homework is due Monday (9.29.14) morning by 9am and should be uploaded to your Github account titled something like "Surf and Paddle" and you should leave a comment on the Github issue assigned to you.
